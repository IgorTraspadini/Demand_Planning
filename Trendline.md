## Why some forecasts are better than others
The error in a forecast, or the residual, is the actual value that occurs minus the forecast.
Forecasts one and two are more accurate than forecasts three and four. That's because we're off by two units in forecasts one and two. 
Forecasts three and four, we see we're always off by five units so you might think these forecasts are sort of identical in quality, but that's not the case. We see with forecast three, sometimes we're too high, and sometimes we're too low. 
In forecast four, we see the error is always negative. It means the actual is less than the forecast, exhibits a 'bias'. We're systematically biased in the sense that our errors are negative, which means that our forecasts were too high.

### Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)
If you get average of the erro (sales - forecast) the positive errors and the negative errors always cancel out if you don't take absolute values, and that's why we had to take absolute values, because otherwise every set of forecasts would look like it was equally good, because the average error was zero. If all your errors are zero, you're MAD will be zero, and that's your benchmark.
