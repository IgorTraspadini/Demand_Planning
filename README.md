How to create and evaluate forecasts?

We'll start by exploring the nature of time series data with scatter plots and moving average plots. Then we'll examine data bias and accuracy using methods including mean apps through deviation and sum of squared errors. Next we'll try out trend lines for forecasting. Then we'll model exponential growth, and compute CAGRs or compound annual growth rates. And finally, let's understand seasonality of data and how to forecast with multiple regression.

## What is time-series data?
Time-series data is a type of data that is collected or recorded over time at regular intervals. In time-series data, each data point is associated with a specific timestamp, allowing for the analysis of changes and trends over a continuous time period. This form of data is prevalent in various fields, including finance, economics, signal processing, weather forecasting, and many other domains where monitoring and analysis of changes over time are essential.

Some examples of time series are shown in bellow:

## Understanding level in a time series
The level of a time series describes the average value of the series.

- "Graph 1" you don't really see a change in level, there appears to be a steady level.
- "Graph 2" you can see the level of revenues increasing, which is plotted on the Y axis versus time is certainly not a steady level.
- "Graph 3" you can see the level decreasing.
